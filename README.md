In order to run simulations in simulations folder there are two necessary downloads:
1. "brainsignals" folder from ElectricBrainSignals:
    - E. Hagen and T. V. Ness. (2023) LFPy/ElectricBrainSignals: ElectricBrainSignals-
v1.0.0rc5. doi: 10.5281/ZENODO.8414232. url: https://zenodo.org/record/
8414232 (downloaded on 2025/02/05 for these simulations)
2. "all_cells_folder": Neocortical neurons from The Blue Brain project, and store in folder called "all_cells_folder".
    - Markram H et al. (2015) Reconstruction and Simulation of Neocortical Microcircuitry. Cell 163:2, 456 - 492. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.029 (downloaded on 2025/03/10 for these simulations)
